# MyShellProject

- **Introduction**

SP-Project 1   -   'My Shell' Program

- **Summary**
This Project is implementing the Background Process Management of common real-world Linux Shell. I developed this program based on a deep understanding of signal handling. More details are on the Document file attached.

- **Requirements**
To execute this program successfully, you need to generate an account on CSPRO server('sftp://cspro.sogang.ac.kr') because this program is suitable to run on ssh shell on CSPRO. Of course, you can run this program on almost all version of ssh shell, not only on CSPRO.

- **Installation**
Unzip the myshell.tar file with 'tar -xvzf' command. After the unzip completes(you may already reach this step since you read this txt file), go to 'sp1' folder and compile source codes with 'make' command. After this, just run it and enjoy!

- **Configuration**
-- sp1 folder with myshell.c, myshell.h, Makefile. 
-- Document.pdf

- **Troubleshooting**
If you have any problem, please read the attached PDF file, or directly contact me via github or email.
